My project is aimed at examining what modern teenagers in Zetland dream about . To achieve this goal, I found a diagram containing some results of relevant opinion polls and analyzed the data. In this essay I will describe my findings and express my opinion on the subject of the project.

Overall, as can be seen from the diagram, there are five main dreams of the interviewed teenagers. Most of the respondents (38%) dream about job promotions whereas only a small minority (10%) want to be financial wellbeing.

I am not surprised that there is not a huge difference between the third and the fourth figures in the diagram: only a 3 percent between having a real estate and a marriage. I think it is obviously, because the teenagers will have their own family in the future, so they will need in a personal accommodation, for example a cottage.

Although some people are very ambitious, they often face some difficulties with realising their dreams. Man can think that he is very smart and strong, but the adult world is not very simple. If the person has not got enough aspiring and work not as hard as he can, he will not reach his goals. I reckon that people have to realise their real opportunities, believe in dreams and do not give up on the way.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the dreams of modern teenagers are very realistic and achievable. Everyone would like to have an own house or be job promoted. I believe that those teenagers, who really want to reach their goals, will do it.
